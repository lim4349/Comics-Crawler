This is made for crawling images in 'https://readcomiconline.to'

I tested only 'Walking Dead', not other comics.

But i am pretty sure they use same format for all comics.

If you want to use this for other comics, you should change url in second block.

Default texture quality is high option.

If you want low-quality pictures, change a word in url 'hq' to 'lq'.

Image will save as title/index.jpg

Only Tested In Mac OS and Chrome

Need Chrome Browser, Selenium, Chrome Driver

chrome driver link : http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

chrome driver must be with crawler.ipynb in same folder.
